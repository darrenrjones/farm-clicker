  0: 'Welcome to Farm Clicker Tycoon! Let\'s get farming! Harvest crops by clicking on a plot of land. Start by harvesting 5 wheat!',
  1: 'Great, now you can feed your crops to the animals! Click on the "animals" button on the top of the screen and sell 5 eggs by clicking the chicken plot 5 times.',
  2: 'When you feed the animals you also instantly sell the products they produce. You can use money to improve your plots. Go to the crops screen, click the "store" button and click the "PLANT WHEAT" button.',
  3: 'Now each click will produce 2 wheat! You can also do this with animals to make more money per click! Be careful though, as each animal in the plot of land consumes their share of food so you need enough for each animal in the plot. The farming Gods have given you $20 to aid you in your journey. Now get to $30 so you can hire some help!',
  4: 'You\'re doing great! In the store view you can hire a manager for each plot of land. Managers will automatically harvest/sell the plot\'s product. Go to the crops view and then to the store view and click "hire manager" in the wheat plot.',
  5: 'Nice! You\'ll be raking in the dough in no time. Be careful though, for if you consume more than you produce, the manager production chain will break and you will have to manually fix it via the store screen. Good luck! Oh, and one more thing, these are magic animals that produce goods without the need of killing or artificial insemination so they are cruelty free!!!',
